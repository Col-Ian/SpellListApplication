# Spell Tablet
This app is intended to be used for the Starfinder Tabletop RPG to manage the spells your character has, or even just as a quick reference. The app can be found on the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.icapps.spelltablet)
## Character

You can create all of your characters in the Character tab. When you select your character, you can edit their level and key ability score as they progress and add spells from the Full List tab.
Your character's level and score will adjust the maximum number of spells known and spells per day in the Saved Spells tab. It will not limit the number of spells you can add in case you get a spell from some other means.

## Full List
In the Full List tab, you can search up any spell, use filters, or toggle the Learnable Spells button (when a character is selected) so you only see the spells your selected character can learn. You can only use the filter for spell levels once a class has been selected to filter, since a spell's level isn't always the same across classes.

The spells are shown in a preview mode. When you select the spell, you can get the full description.

## Saved Spells
In the Saved Spells tab, the spells that your character has saved will be displayed. All spells will be ordered by spell level with collapsable lists for each level. You can see how many spells your character should know, and how many spells per day of that level you may cast.
