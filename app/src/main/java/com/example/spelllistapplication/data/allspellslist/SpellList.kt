For example, if both bodies are in the same explosive blast, you attempt the saving throw only once and take the damage only once.

Both bodies count as one creature for spell effects, and they can’t be chosen more than once for such effects. Any magical effect on you has its duration halved while you’re bilocating. For example, the aforementioned hold person loses 2 rounds of duration each round it paralyzes you and your duplicate.
